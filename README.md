After years of helping organizations work through their challenges, I’ve spent most of my time listening to what people actually struggle with—not what vendors say they should care about.

Over time, the same patterns kept coming back.

I’m not a developer by training, but I’ve always been into technology. I can read code, understand how things fit together, and I’ve been running my own website since the ’90s.

Today, with automation lowering many barriers, I focus on connecting real problems with simple, practical tools that people can actually use.

## 🎯 The Real Problems

**Your data is centralized.**

When you use cloud services, password managers, email—your credentials, keys, and sensitive data live on someone else's servers. That means:

- **You're not in control** - A corporation decides the rules. They can change them.
- **You're exposed to surveillance** - Governments, corporations, hackers all have one target: centralized databases.
- **You're one data leak away from disaster** - When (not if) that service gets hacked, your credentials are compromised. You didn't cause it. You can't prevent it. You just suffer.

**The privacy problem is real:**

> "I don't have anything to hide"—but you also don't invite strangers into your house just because you're not doing anything illegal.

Your passwords shouldn't live with tech companies. Your encryption keys shouldn't be in someone's cloud. Your data shouldn't depend on whether a corporation's security is good enough.

**The backup problem is real:**

> "My network went down. I couldn't access any files. Everything was locked behind cloud services I couldn't reach."

When systems fail, centralized backups don't help you. You need something that survives network outages.

**The compliance problem is real:**

> "We're supposed to be encrypting this, but it's all with a cloud provider. How do we actually control it? How do we even know what's secure?"

Compliance means control. You can't comply if you don't control the infrastructure.

## 🔍 What I Learned

After listening to these problems, I started thinking about what actually matters:

- **Transparency** - You should be able to read the code, understand what's happening
- **Control** - Your data stays yours. Your encryption keys stay in your hands
- **Simplicity** - You shouldn't need a team of experts to use security tools
- **Pragmatism** - A tool that solves 80% of a real problem is better than nothing.

## 💡 The Approach

Each tool tries to be:

**Multiplatform** - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

**Transparent** - Open source. You can read the code. Security researchers can verify it.  

**Practical** - Simple and intuitive. Windows drag & drop. Built for everyone, not just experts.

## 🔧 The Tools

### 🗝️ FileSecureSuite

Generate encryption keys and encrypt files with hybrid encryption (AES-256-GCM + RSA-4096). Works with large files. No setup complexity—Windows drag & drop, cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS). 

Create throwaway keys for single conversations or permanent keys for long-term storage. Keep encryption under your control, not a vendor's. Encrypt sensitive documents, backup credentials, archive confidential data. Uses published FSS1 format so your files stay decryptable for the future.

### 🔲 QRVaultLink

Transform sensitive data (SSH keys, API tokens, passwords, documents) into encrypted QR codes. Transfer via visual sharing instead of email or cloud—physically secure, instantly verifiable, no network required. Works offline. Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS). Print QR codes on paper for backup and recovery.

Built on FSS1 encryption standard for seamless integration with FileSecureSuite: encrypt with one tool, decrypt with another. Create a unified security ecosystem.

### 🔊 SonarLink

Transfer files between computers using sound waves. No network. No WiFi. No Bluetooth. Just speakers and microphones in the same room. Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS).

For facilities that intentionally have no internet. For emergency situations when networks are down. For transferring data that needs to stay physically contained.
