# Hi, I’m Mariano Peluso

I’m a **marketing and strategy consultant** with a long-standing interest in how data, technology, and digital systems shape perception, decision-making, and behavior.

I don’t use GitHub as a portfolio of production-ready software, but as a **personal lab** — a place to explore ideas, prototypes, and conceptual tools at the intersection of marketing, technology, privacy, and culture.

## What I do professionally

I work with organizations and professionals on:
- **Strategic marketing and positioning**
- **Market and competitive analysis**
- **Data-informed decision-making**
- Translating complexity into **clear narratives and actionable frameworks**

My background is not engineering-first, but **analysis- and meaning-first**: I focus on how systems are understood, communicated, trusted, and adopted.

## Writing & research

Alongside my consulting work, I publish essays and papers in more reflective and research-oriented contexts.
My publications are available via ORCID:

## Why I’m on GitHub

Technology doesn’t only live in products — it lives in **interfaces, metaphors, protocols, and constraints**.

This space allows me to:
- Experiment with **conceptual and technical prototypes**
- Explore alternative ways of moving data, meaning, and trust
- Better understand the logic behind the tools that shape markets and behavior
- Bridge **marketing thinking and technical realities**

The repositories you’ll find here are **experimental, exploratory, and sometimes intentionally minimal**.

This GitHub profile sits between my consulting work and my writing: a space to think, test, and explore ideas through technical artifacts.

## Selected experiments

The following repositories are small-scale experiments designed to explore ideas rather than deliver finished products.


- 🔊 **SonarLink**  
  Exploring encrypted file and message transfer using sound as a physical medium, outside traditional network layers.

- 🔐 **FileSecureSuite**  
  Lightweight tools focused on local-first encryption and data control.

- 📎 **QrVaultLink**  
  Experiments around secure, offline-friendly sharing through QR-based workflows.

These projects are not commercial products — they are **thinking tools**.

## How to read this profile

If you’re a developer:  
You’ll find ideas that lean more toward **systems, use cases, and implications** than code optimization.

If you’re in marketing, strategy, or product:  
This profile reflects how I approach technology — not as a black box, but as something that must be **understood, framed, and communicated** to create value.

If you’re an organization:  
I’m particularly interested in environments where **technology, narrative, and strategy intersect**.

## Interests & themes

- Technology as an environment, not just a tool  
- Privacy, decentralization, and trust  
- Interfaces and constraints as behavioral design  
- Data, consumption, and ways of seeing the world  
- Coffee ☕ as a cognitive and cultural system
